# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React and Vite. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of being the first to get three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/axelldev/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to play the game.

## Gameplay

1. Click on an empty square to make your move.
2. The game will automatically alternate between "X" and "O" players.
3. The game will announce the winner when there is one or declare a draw if there are no more moves left.
4. To start a new game, click the "Restart" button.

## Customization

You can customize the game further by modifying the source code. You can change the colors, styles, or even add additional features to make it your own.
